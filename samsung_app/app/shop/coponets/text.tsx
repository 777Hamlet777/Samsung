        θWhile supplies last for any then Eligible Model, and until this
        Promotion is terminated, whichever is earlier (the “Purchase Period”),
        Participants who complete all steps, including identifying your old TV
        to be traded in (“Qualifying Trade-In TV”) and purchasing a then
        Eligible Model (“Qualifying Purchase”), will automatically at checkout
        receive a trade-in credit (the “Promotional Trade-In Credit”) for use
        toward the purchase price for that Qualifying Purchase, only on
        Samsung.com or through the Shop Samsung App. The value of the
        Promotional Trade-In Credit will be set forth when you add the Eligible
        Model and this Promotion to your cart. Your Qualifying Trade-In TV must
        be ready for haul away at the time of delivery of your new Qualifying
        Purchase. ** Participants must pay all applicable taxes and delivery
        fees on the Qualifying Purchase. Such taxes and fees are all due at the
        time of sale. Full Terms apply.

        1For a limited time only, on Samsung.com/Shop Samsung App, or purchase a
        new qualifying Galaxy device ("Qualifying Purchase"), send in your
        qualifying trade-in device to Samsung through the Samsung Trade-In
        Program, and if Samsung determines your trade-in device meets all
        eligibility requirements, you will receive a trade-in credit specific to
        your qualifying trade-in device to apply toward your Qualifying
        Purchase. Device models that currently qualify for trade-in and trade-in
        credit amounts associated with those models are available on Samsung.com
        and the Shop Samsung App; eligible models and amounts may change at
        Samsung's sole discretion. To be eligible for trade-in, your qualifying
        device must meet all Trade-In Program eligibility requirements, which
        include, but are not limited to, that the device powers on, holds a
        charge, and does not power off unexpectedly; has a functioning display;
        has no breaks or cracks in the screen (unless a cracked screen offer
        applies); has no breaks or cracks in the case; has no liquid damage
        (whether visible or not); has no other defects that go beyond normal
        wear and tear; is not on a black list; has a verified FCC ID; has been
        reset to factory settings; has all personal information removed; has all
        software locks disabled; and is owned by you (leased devices are not
        eligible). Anticipated trade-in value will be applied as a credit at
        time of purchase, but, if you do not send in your trade-in device within
        15 days of receipt of your Qualifying Purchase, you will be charged back
        for the trade-in credit applied to your purchase, or if you send in your
        trade-in device within 15 days of receipt of your Qualifying Purchase
        but Samsung determines your device does not meet all eligibility
        requirements, you will be charged back for the trade-in credit applied
        to your purchase minus $25. Participation in this program does not
        excuse you from contracts with your carrier or retailer (or any related
        payments or fees) for the device that was traded in. Limit 1 trade-in
        per Qualifying Purchase. Samsung reserves the right to modify or
        discontinue this offer at any time. The Trade-In Program cannot be
        combined with any other Samsung, carrier or retailer promotions,
        discounts, or offers unless specifically provided for in the terms and
        conditions of such offers. Additional terms, including terms that govern
        the resolution of disputes, apply.
